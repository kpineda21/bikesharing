### Analysis

According to the data gathered, we verified what the best hours for maintance are, if there are more subscribers than customers, and if the size of the population will affect how many people use the bikes. We also gathered additional data that provides Des Moines climate for each month to determine when we would be the busiest, and the top 12 tourists sites and universities, to determine where stations should be placed. 

Within a 13 mile radius in Des Moines, you will find the top 12 tourist attractions, and at least 5 universities. Having a bike service in this area will allow tourists to enjoy these multiple sites and also the students that attend the universities can get around with ease. I would recommend having stations around the universities and around the attractions in this area, including the local 3+ star hotels. 

We gathered the population of New York City and Des Moines to compare, but they are drastically different in numbers.  There is no comparison. 

New York City population 8.399 million
Des Moines population 217,000

However, we did further research and on the catch Des Moines website, there is research that shows that the Greater Des Moines region welcomed 13.7 million visitors in 2016. Also, visitor spending accounted for a record of $838M in spending that year. Therefore, you can conclude that a bike service in this area can be profitable with the number of tourists that visited this area and the locals.

Also, the website Catch Des Moines also provides climate data. The busiest months for the bike service would be between April-October. This site also provides fun for every season, which means no matter what the weather is, there is always something to do. Therefore, when the bike service is offered we can suggest our customers different options around the area depending on the season. 

Looking at the NYC Citi Bike Data, we can conclude that the best hours for maintainance are between 2:00 am - 5:00 am. Which are the slowest hours throughout the day. 

Also, after reviewing NYC Citi Bike Data, we determined that people who use the bike service are subscribers. 81% are subscribers compared to 19% customers. This means that there is a larger number of repeat users, which we can conclude that most riders must be locals.
